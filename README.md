# 👨‍💻 Robin Tymi – Web Developer

Welcome to my portfolio!  
I have successfully completed the **Developer Akademie** and hold a **certification as a Frontend Developer**.  
My goal is to work as a **Fullstack Developer**, and I am actively building and deploying fullstack applications to deepen my backend expertise.

I enjoy creating modern, responsive web applications and continuously expanding my technical skill set.
